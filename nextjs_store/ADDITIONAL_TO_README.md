Warning!
Code not 100% complete!
Check out the README.md file!
Everything, that requires creating account (the stuff, which are said to be free, but those have paid versions as well, so I had no peace about creating account and install for those) and installing with terminal based commands (like Prisma, Stripe and all the others, which are for payment imitating, database handling, and so on), are left out of the entire project!
The project is from an Udemy course!
Educational purposes and project experiment purposes only!
